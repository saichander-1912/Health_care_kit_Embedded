ABSTRACT


        Traditional methods of healthcare demand the patient to visit the clinic on a regular basis. 
These conventional methods can be quite cumbersome for both the patient as well as the medical 
staff. The focus of this paper is to implement a smart Emdedded based health monitoring system 
with the of “Health Care Kit” which uses noninvasive sensors to read different health parameters 
and displays it instantly on an LCD module. Additionally, the user has the option of calculating 
his/her BMI while helps them to display their obesity characteristics. With this characteristics a 
patient will change his/her diet and Medication according to their health status and physical 
strongness(Obesity). This will helps to the doctors to give medication according to their physical 
strongness. 


        Throughout the course of this project, extensive work was undertaken to design and 
implement a Health Monitoring System that combines hardware and software components 
seamlessly. The system was built around an Arduino microcontroller, interfaced with a 4x4 keypad 
for user input, a 16x2 LCD display for data output, and LED indicators to provide visual feedback. 
The software logic was meticulously crafted to process user-entered data, including temperature, 
pulse rate, height, and weight, and deliver real-time health metrics such as BMI. The system's user
friendly interface allowed for easy data input, making it accessible to individuals of varying 
technical backgrounds. 


      In conclusion, this project achieved its primary objective of creating a functional and user
friendly Health Monitoring System. It has the potential to benefit individuals by offering a practical 
tool for tracking their health metrics conveniently and in real time. The interactive nature of the 
system, combined with LED feedback, enhances user engagement and understanding. While the 
project was successful in its goals, there is room for further refinement and expansion. Future 
enhancements could include additional sensors for more comprehensive health data, wireless 
connectivity for remote monitoring, and a user-friendly graphical interface. Overall, this project 
serves as a valuable example of how technology can be harnessed to promote personal well-being 
and health awareness.
